## Getting Started

Install this project (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/terrafarm/gatsby-casper-demo
gatsby develop
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repo or a fork of the repo and install it manually.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/terrafarm/gatsby-casper-demo YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # Optional, you can leave the .git history for future rebasing
npm install # or yarn install
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

## Configuration

 Edit the export object in `data/SiteConfig`:

## Content

### Posts

Posts are authored using Markdown and include some optional YAML frontmatter data properties.  Each post should have a separate folder for the .md file in addition to any images or other media related to that post.  Posts are stored in a subfolder in the ```/content/``` directory; the target subfolder is set by the _blogPostDir_ property in _SiteConfig.js_.

### Authors

Each post can reference the author of the post, if the author is not set the default author will be used; which is controlled by the _blogAuthorId_ property in _SiteConfig.js_.  All authors, including the default author (aka _blodAuthorId_) must have an author JSON file.  These JSON files MUST be stored in a folder names ```authors```, for Gatsby to parse them correctly.  The location of this ```authors``` folder can be controlled by the _blogAuthorDir_ property in _SiteConfig.js_. It IS possible to have the ```authors``` folder inside the  _blogPostDir_ folder.
